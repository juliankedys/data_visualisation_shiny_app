The bins for ratings each span half a rating point on a 0-10 scale."),

        h2("2. Interactive Film Table"),

Depending on the data type of the column the searchbar is either a text input field or a slider which allows the user to limit the scope of values of displayed results. To exemplify, feature 'adult' can be filtered by typing 'True' or 'False', whereas numerical columns such as 'vote_average' allow the user to set the minimum and maximum threshold for filtering the data on this characteristic. Note that the text fields are reactive and so any sufficiently unique phrase is enough to filter the data (e.g. just typing 'T' into the 'adult' column's searchbar would already effectively return the filtered data). Furthemore, column-bound searching tools are case-insensitive. On top of that, there are two global searchbars. One designated with 'Search film title' text which can be used for filtering the data using the films' titles, and the other for searching through the entire dataset with text-based queries. The former of the two, as opposed to the latter, is case-sensitive and its input is treated as a single phrase irrespective of the number of words it comprises. Consequently, typing 'big hero' in the first searchbar would yeild no results, yet if one searched 'Big Hero' then the corresponding film - Disney's 'Big Hero 6' - would appear. The other global search on the other hand would return any film containing either the word 'big' or 'hero' anywhere in its title, tagline, overview etc. upon the same query being entered. Moreover, any column can be used for sorting the table by the feature it contains. It can be done by clicking the column's name once for sorting in ascending order and the second time for descending order. The datatable can be navigated both by using the provided scrollbars or by moving two fingers across the touchpad. Finally, upon clicking on the datatable's rows, the most pertinent information is displayed about the films."),
